# Task 2: Customer Behavior Analysis

## Objective
Create SQL queries to analyze customer behavior and sales trends.

## Requirements
Write SQL queries in `task2.sql` to extract the following information:
1. Monthly sales volume for each product.
2. Average sales amount per customer.
3. Identify the customer(s) with the highest total purchase amount.

## Guidelines
- Use SQL functions to aggregate data on a monthly basis and calculate averages and maximum values.
- Ensure clear and commented SQL queries for each requested information.
- Refer to the provided dataset (`data.csv`) for querying.

Submission:
- Write your SQL queries for Task 2 in the `task2.sql` file within the `/sql` directory.
- Create a pull request with your changes to the main branch upon completion.

Applicants are expected to write SQL queries in separate files (`task1.sql` and `task2.sql`) within the `/sql` directory, each focusing on specific information extraction and analysis from the sales dataset. The provided dataset (`data.csv`) should be used for all queries. Clear and commented SQL queries are recommended for easy evaluation.
