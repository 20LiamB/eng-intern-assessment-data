# Task 1: SQL Queries for Sales Analysis

## Objective 
Write SQL queries to extract specific information from the sales dataset.

## Requirements:
Write SQL queries in `task1.sql` to retrieve the following information:
1. Total sales amount for each product.
2. Top 5 products by sales amount.
3. Number of unique customers who made purchases.

## Guidelines:
- Use appropriate SQL functions for aggregation, sorting, and counting.
- Ensure clear and commented SQL queries for each requested information.
- Utilize the provided dataset (`sales_data.csv`) for querying.

## Submission:
- Write your SQL queries for Task 1 in the `task1.sql` file within the `/sql` directory.
- Create a pull request with your changes to the main branch upon completion.

Applicants are expected to write SQL queries in separate files (`task1.sql` and `task2.sql`) within the `/sql` directory, each focusing on specific information extraction and analysis from the sales dataset. The provided dataset (`data.csv`) should be used for all queries. Clear and commented SQL queries are recommended for easy evaluation.
